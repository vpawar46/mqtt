# ========================================
# MQTT Broker Configuration
# ========================================

# MQTT broker hostname or IP address
MQTT_BROKER=localhost

# MQTT broker port (default: 1883 for TCP, 8883 for TLS)
MQTT_PORT=1883

# MQTT authentication (leave empty if not required)
MQTT_USERNAME=
MQTT_PASSWORD=

# ========================================
# Topic Subscription Options
# ========================================

# Option 1: Use Gate ID to auto-generate topics
# This will subscribe to:
#   - {GATE_ID}_localfirst
#   - {GATE_ID}_parkbox
#   - {GATE_ID}_status
#   - {GATE_ID}_events
GATE_ID=23

# Option 2: Manually specify topics (comma-separated)
# Use MQTT wildcards: + (single level), # (multi-level)
# Examples:
#   - sensor/temperature
#   - sensor/#
#   - devices/+/status
#   - alerts/critical,alerts/warning
# MQTT_TOPICS=sensor/temperature,sensor/humidity,alerts/#

# ========================================
# Notes
# ========================================
# - If both GATE_ID and MQTT_TOPICS are provided, both sets will be subscribed
# - If neither is provided, subscribes to all topics (#)
# - Wildcards:
#     # = subscribe to all sub-topics (e.g., sensor/# matches sensor/temp, sensor/humidity/room1)
#     + = subscribe to one level (e.g., sensor/+/temp matches sensor/room1/temp, sensor/room2/temp)
# - For production, use specific topics instead of wildcards for better performance


# Show detailed message payloads (true/false)
# false = only show topic and message size
# true = show topic, size, and full payload
DETAILED=false
